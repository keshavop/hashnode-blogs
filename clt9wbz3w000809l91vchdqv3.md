## ***Spring Boot basics***

Spring Boot is a widely-used Java framework designed for web service development. It simplifies the process of configuring and deploying web applications by offering default settings, dependencies, and features. Additionally, Spring Boot supports various web service standards, including REST, SOAP, and GraphQL, making it a versatile choice for developers.

## ***Bean validation***

Bean validation is a standard Java specification used for validating object properties in a Spring Boot web service. It employs annotations like ***NotNull***, ***Size***, or ***Pattern*** to specify validation rules for each property. Custom validators can be created by implementing the ConstraintValidator interface. To enable bean validation, add the spring-boot-starter-validation dependency to your project. This ensures a robust mechanism for validating input data in your Spring Boot applications.

## ***Controller advice***

In Spring Boot, an alternative approach to validating input in a web service is to utilize Controller Advice. This mechanism manages exceptions and errors across controllers. With controller advice, you can define global or specific handlers for various exception types, including MethodArgumentNotValidException, triggered during bean validation failures. Mark your handler methods with annotations like ***ControllerAdvice*** and ***ExceptionHandler***, specifying the exceptions they manage. Customize the HTTP status and response body of error messages using annotations like ***ResponseStatus*** and ***ResponseBody***. This provides a flexible way to handle and respond to validation issues in your Spring Boot application.

## ***Validation groups***

In Spring Boot, another approach to validating input is through validation groups. Validation groups involve using interfaces that group validation rules based on different scenarios or contexts, such as creating or updating a resource. The ***Validated*** annotation allows you to specify the validation group for each controller method. Additionally, the ***GroupSequence*** annotation aids in defining the order of validation groups. This provides a structured way to apply distinct validation rules to the same bean depending on the specific context within your Spring Boot web service.

## ***Testing validation***

To ensure the effectiveness of your validation logic in a Spring Boot web service, testing through unit and integration tests is crucial. Employ tools like JUnit, Mockito, and Spring Boot Test for creating and executing tests. The ***WebMvcTest*** and ***MockBean*** annotations prove beneficial for concentrating on testing the web layer while mocking dependencies. This comprehensive testing strategy allows you to validate the behavior of your web service under various scenarios, confirming its correct response to both valid and invalid input.
